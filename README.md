### Technologies Used

* [Python] - Programming Language
* [HTML] - Markup Language
* [CSS] - Styles.
* [jQuery] - Javascript Library
* [Bootstrap] - A framework for responsive design

### Dependencies

* Git must be installed on your system, otherwise you can download the zip from from github
* Python must be installed on your system

### Usage (on Ubuntu, or other GNU/Linux based Operating Systems)

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] movietrailerwebsite
$ cd movietrailerwebsite
$ python entertainment_center.py
```

Once you run the script, it will create a file named "fresh_tomatoes.html", and open it in your default web browser automatically.

### Usage (on Windows)

Note: I have never executed a python script on windows, so i am not entirely sure that the below instructions will work,
they are based on my general experience of executing things on windows

```sh
$ open git bash (or command prompt if you have added git environment variables) (this depends on how you configured to use git)
$ git clone [git-repo-url] movietrailerwebsite
$ cd movietrailerwebsite
$ open command prompt
$ cd to the python executable path (or you run directly without navigating if you have added python.exe to the environment variables)
$ python.exe entertainment_center.py

Once you run the script, it will create a file named "fresh_tomatoes.html", and open it in your default web browser automatically.
